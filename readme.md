# EarlSchool

Working through [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list) problems in [Earl Grey](https://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/).  Some of the solutions don't pass tests due to the tests looking for specific named async/sync functions. These are noted with a comment inside the file.  Thankfully the workshopper package still shows that the results match!

Each folder is a separate "course" on the NodeSchool website.

## Vision

It'd be really cool to build this out into a full featured set of workshops for Earl Grey.  Much of what NodeSchool does would just work as is, in fact.  But I would like to start by getting a working prototype and then iterate into the stack rewriting what makes sense to rewrite.  This is definitely a *long-term* vision.  Even longer term? I'd want to do something like [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) and have a website with some minor gamification/certification features.
